                A registration form is a list of fields that a user will input data into and submit to a company or individual.
                There are many reasons why you would want a person to fill out a registration form.
                Companies use registration forms to sign up customers for subscriptions, services, or other programs or plans.
                Sign up if you are new to this Website and want to register. Login if you have already filled the form.
